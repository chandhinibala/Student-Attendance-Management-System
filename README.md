# Student-Attendance-Management-System
This is a semi-automated Java application with Java Swing as the front end and csv files as the database. It has a login portal, which enables both the faculty and student to login. The database already has the information about the attendance of each student , for every course, allotted over months. The database could be done through csv file reading from already prepared excel sheets. The sheet consisted of the number of hours a student was present including late, excused and unexcused. Using this information , both the normal percentage and the compensated percentage can also be also calculated. A well- defined warning instructor can be implemented in this project for faculties to know who all lag attendance . Attendance report can also be viewed by the faculties subject wise on a monthly basis for all students whereas students can view their attendance and compensated attendance in the student report. Modification of student details can also be performed by faculties through their login. This is a unique , very handy and yet useful project for administration of student attendance.
